## CUSTOM FONT BUILD
This fonts pack also gives you the possibility of building your own font.

With the help of [Font Forge](https://fontforge.org) its possible to open both: **Hypnotize Icons Master.ttf** and **Custom Build.ttf** (an empty ready to use font which already includes the best setting for quality)

Inside Font Forge is possible to select the desired glyphs from the Hypnotize Icons Master and copy them over to the Custom Build font which once complete can be saved from *file > Generate Font > make sure to select TrueType as a font extension and Generate*, resulting in new icon font usable in HUD development!
